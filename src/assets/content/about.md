## What is this?
This service collects your input, sends it to a big calculator, allows it to think about it for a while and 
displays the received result back to you.

Be aware that this is actually a very hard mathematical problem, see "bin packing problem" for technical details. 
This means that this calculator will only guarantee perfect results up to 10 elements, anything more will fall back to
a fast, but easily fooled algorithm. 

## FAQ
*Could this be done on this website, on my device, in the background?*

This wouldn't just be possible, it might even be a lot faster. Unfortunately, the calculator was there first ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

*Do you steal my valuable data and sell it to shady criminals on the black market?*

No, is that something that people do? Do I need to worry about that?  
To be honest, I wouldn't know what to do with it.
If you have a nice project email me instead, so I can look at your fine work.

## Why did you build this?
This project was born out of the need to cut lengths of steel tubing. Ordering everything
pre-cut is easy, but costs at least 30% more. I had everything needed to trim them to size at home, 
but I needed to know how many stock bars to order and where to cut them. The usual solution is just staring 
at the problem until you see a solution, but that's not really how it should work. 

I finished that project years before looking for an answer, but the problem kept arising, which is why 
I finally caved in and developed this tool. 

## How can I thank you for this thing?
Tell me how you used this tool, happiness and being praised is the main reason I develop stuff like this. 

You could also donate some spare change, which is even better, but I won't force you to do anything. 
I will be forever grateful if support me in keeping this website up, right now I am paying around 5€/month 
to make this service available for everybody.

## Development
Have a look at [CutSolverFrontend](https://github.com/ModischFabrications/CutSolverFrontend) if you want to see 
how this website works on the inside. You are welcome to add to it if you see any improvements :) 

You can send also jobs to my backend directly, see [CutSolver](https://github.com/ModischFabrications/CutSolver). 
Please don't abuse or break it. Feel free to send an issue or merge request if you find a vulnerability.
